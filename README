Jantire was a digital turn-in box for homework that's graded on completion.

I'm not working on it anymore.

Feel free to do whatever you want with it.

Beware, I didn't write any tests and there are several UX issues.

How to get it working:
	1. Register for an account at Scribd with an API key (http://www.scribd.com/developers).
	2. Place the login information and API key in Rails.root/config/initializers/rscribd.rb
	3. If you have an S3 account and buckets set them up in config/s3.yml

By default all accounts are student accounts. 
Teacher accounts are instances of the User model with the 'teacher' attribute set to true.
